    <p>I understand you have a lot of choices in ordering espresso-based beverages at work today, so I just wanted to take a moment and thank you for choosing CoffeeBreak. It means a lot. This is a small web page thrown together <small>very</small> quickly that tries to provide centralized espresso beverage ordering and at-desk notifications.</p>

    <p>I make absolutely no claims to the reliability of this website. If it messes up and you don't get your coffee, please don't yell at me!</p>
