    <p>I understand you have a lot of choices in ordering coffee at work today, so I just wanted to take a moment and thank you for choosing CoffeeBreak. It means a lot. This is a <small>very</small> quickly thrown together web page that tries to provide centralized espresso beverage ordering and at-desk notifications.</p>

    <p>I make absolutely no claims to the reliability of this website.</p>
